		1.0 :	created from argos3	22/03/2019
				with a basic morphology implementation
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This git repository works with argos3 (https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3)

run.sh

To run the scenario, there are two cases, depending on how did you install 
your argos3

1. if you run your argos from build directory without install to the system
	please specify the argos build directory at the first line of run.sh,
	and simply:
		bash run.sh
	
2. if you install argos to the system
	I think simply 
		argos3 -c vns.argos
	will work.

This is the key file that argos3 run with, describing everything about the scenario

are sometimes just called robots), the lua controller of each is specified at 
line 33 and line 60 (or nearby) in vns.argos
